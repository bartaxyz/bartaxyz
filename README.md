### Hey! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm **OndÅ™ej BÃ¡rta**,

You can mostly find me at the intersection of technology and design. I profoundly enjoy the act of creating. A large portion of my free time is, therefore, dedicated to learning about and creating things that I find useful, beautiful or both.

Most of my work is private for clients or for my day job. The rest is here, free to be inspected, used or changed by others as per the spirit of open-source.
